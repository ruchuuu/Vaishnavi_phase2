Submit the correct location within a radius of 250 m to get the flag.
# Solution
Searched the buildings around on Google Lens. Found it on a local Japanese real estate site. The building's location was not on the map but the parking lot next to it was listed on the map. This parking lot was 2 blocks down the station. Pinning that location got the flag. Bonsai Bankai is 3 blocks down to the right of Heisei station.
