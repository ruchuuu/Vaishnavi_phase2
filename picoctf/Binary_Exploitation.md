# 1. Format string 0
> Using knowledge of format strings to give the correct commands to netcat connection to get the flag.
## Solution:
- Through the description and hint provided, the correct command revolved around format specifiers.
- Used the webshell (terminal) given in the site and connected to the address given.
- The output started with an interface where we had to choose 1 correct option out of the three.
- Since, specifiers start with % sign, I tried the options with % first and got the flag upon the correct command.
- Also, the source code shows %s highlighted in the option strings, indicating that it is the right option.

picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}

```
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_f89c1405}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
- Format specifiers of strings in c programming- %s
- %114d is a specifier for signed decimal with atleast 114 characters.
- %to prints argument in octal numbers.
## Notes: 
- I saw the % sign in pe%to option and thought that it might be the correct answer.
- But that printed the octal value Pe20021560_Portobello instead.
- This is where I learned that %to converts to octal numbers.
- Then I followed the %s pattern in cheesesteak option to get the flag.
