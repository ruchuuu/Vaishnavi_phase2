> Log into http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:60454/index.php as the admin using SQL injections in rounds to get the flag.

## Solution:
- The site is a login page where we can enter username and password. Usually such sites can be accessed using SQL injection with admin or 1=1 commands.
- The filter page showed the words/characters blocked by the site. So keeping those in mind gave admin'-- injection because 'or' was blocked.
- Round 2 blocked and, like,=,--. Next injection- admin' /*.
- Round 3 blocked ><. Next- admin';.
- Round 4 blocked admin. Next- ad'||'min';. Used concatenation operator to make the word 'admin'.
- Round 5 blocked union but the previous injection still worked.
- The complete source code was on the filter page with the flag at the end as comment.

##  Flag:
```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
- SQL injection can be done when a site asks for user input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, an SQL statement can be run unknowingly on database.
- The SQL injection 1=1 is valid and will return all values, since OR 1=1 is always true. This can give access to such sites without the need of passwords.

## Notes:
- I did not understand the purpose of the filter page, and therefore tried to use 'or' with admin and 1=1 in round 1. But when that didn't give me access, I read the address of the page along with the given hints and realised that it indicated the filters blocked for the round.
