## Solution:
- The name suggests that the text is RSA encoded. Using an online RSA decoder, I entered the values of N, e and c and got the flag.
## Flag:
```
picoCTF{n33d_a_lArg3r_e_d0cd6eae}
```
## Concept Learnt:
- RSA: The Public Key is used for encryption and is known to everyone, while the Private Key is used for decryption and must be kept secret by the receiver.
- e is the public exponent, a component of the public key and a number used to encrypt messages. A common and efficient choice for e is 65537.
- But here, a smaller e is used- single digit number.

# 2. Custom encryption
> Get sense of the code file and write the function that will decode the given encrypted file content.
## Solution:
- From the hint, we are supposed to analyze the encryption algorithm and come up with decryption algorithm.
- Upon reversing the logic in the source code, it can be used to decrypt the flag.
- Such as writing decrypt instead of encrypt function, ciphertext with plaintext and vice-versa. Also change the data type from array(int) to string (char) for cipher to plain.
- Enter the given values of a and b and ciphertext in message input.
- Then run the code to get the flag.
- The decryption code is below with comments at every change done from original source code.

```python
from random import randint
import sys


def generator(g, x, p):
    return pow(g, x) % p


def decrypt(ciphertext, key): # decrypt function that takes each integer from ciphertext and divides it by key which is then divided by 311 (since each char from plaintext is multiplied)
    plain = ""
    for num in ciphertext:
        plain+= chr(int((num / key / 311))) # num and key already converted to int, the division then converted to characters for plain string.
    return plain # return the plain string obtained



def is_prime(p):
    v = 0
    for i in range(2, p + 1):
        if p % i == 0:
            v = v + 1
    if v > 1:
        return False
    else:
        return True


def dynamic_xor_decrypt(ciphertext, text_key): # dynamic_xor_decrypt function loops each character of ciphertext to use bitwise XOR on ASCII value of each ciphertext character and ASCII of each key character.
    plain_text = ""
    key_length = len(text_key)
    for i, char in enumerate(ciphertext):
        key_char = text_key[i % key_length]
        decrypted_char = chr(ord(char) ^ ord(key_char))
        plain_text += decrypted_char # The decrypted characters get added to plain_text to make a string.
    return plain_text


def test(cipher_text, text_key):
    p = 97
    g = 31
    if not is_prime(p) and not is_prime(g):
        print("Enter prime numbers")
        return
    a = 90 #randint(p-10, p) # a set to 90
    b = 26 #randint(g-10, g) # b set to 26
    print(f"a = {a}")
    print(f"b = {b}")
    u = generator(g, a, p)
    v = generator(g, b, p)
    key = generator(v, a, p)
    b_key = generator(u, b, p)
    shared_key = None
    if key == b_key:
        shared_key = key
    else:
        print("Invalid key")
        return
    semi_cipher = decrypt(cipher_text, shared_key) # Performs the decrypt function on cipher_text and the shared_key generated through v,a,p
    plain = dynamic_xor_decrypt(semi_cipher, text_key) # dynamic_xor_decrypt performed on the semi_cipher with text_key to get the plain string.
    print(f'plain is: {plain[::-1]}') # Reverse the plain string because in the original code, the plaintext is reversed so the ciphertext also comes out to be reversed.

```

## Flag:
```
picoCTF{custom_d2cr0pt6d_49fbee5b}
```
## Concepts Learnt:
- Upon searching, I found out that the generate function is similar to Diffie-Hellman key exchange, that is, a fundamental cryptographic protocol used to allow two parties to securely agree on a shared secret over an insecure channel without ever sending the secret itself.
- XOR is reversible: plaintext can be found by reversing the ciphertext logic.

## Notes:
- I had not converted `(num/ key/311)` into char and got an error because plain variable is declared as string.

# 3. rsa_oracle
> Can you abuse the oracle? An attacker was able to intercept communications between a bank and a fintech company. They managed to get the message (ciphertext) and the password that was used to encrypt the message. Figure out how to decrypt the password in this connection nc titan.picoctf.net 64327 since the server can decrypt anything except the password.

## Solution:
- Since the password itself cannot be decrypted by the server, we need to find a way to trick the server.
- If we send 2 for encryption, we get back 2^e mod n and the password (m^e mod n) to the server, this will make (2m)^e mod n as ciphertext and decrypt it.
- Then divide 2 from the decrypted plaintext to get the actual message.
- Come up with a python script to send the connection this cipher.

```python
from pwn import * # pwntools python library for remote(), sendline(), recvline()
from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes, bytes_to_long # pycryptodome library for int to raw-bytes/big-endian conversions

cipher = 2336150584734702647514724021470643922433811330098144930425575029773908475892259185520495303353109615046654428965662643241365308392679139063000973730368839

r = remote('titan.picoctf.net', 64327) # create connection

def decrypt_oracle(ct): # takes a ciphertext(ct) and sends it to the oracle to get the decrypted message modulus n
    r.sendlineafter(b'decrypt.', b'D') # waits for decrypt prompt and enters D
    r.sendlineafter(b': ', str(ct).encode()) # waits for a prompt ending with ': ', and sends the ciphertext ct as a string.
    try:
        r.recvuntil(b'mod n): ') # waits for the oracle to print a prompt that ends with mod n): (oracle will output the decrypted value mod n next).
        h = r.recvline().strip().decode() # read the next line from server, removes spaces and converts to string
        if len(h) % 2 != 0: # ensuring even bytes for hex decoding
            h = '0' + h
        return bytes_to_long(bytes.fromhex(h)) # returns the integer value represented by the byte string.
    except EOFError: # if server closes, return none
        return None

def encrypt_oracle(pt):
    r.sendlineafter(b'decrypt.', b'E') # enter E instead of D as before
    r.sendlineafter(b': ', long_to_bytes(pt)) # sends a converted plaintext to server (integer to its bigâ€‘endian byte representation)
    r.recvuntil(b'mod n) ')
    return int(r.recvline().strip().decode()) # returns integer format of the string

res = decrypt_oracle(cipher * encrypt_oracle(2)) # gets 2 encrypted as 2^e mod n and ciphertext*(2^e mod n) = m^e*2^e= (2m)^e mod n. Decrypting this cipher will give the plaintext*2.
if res is None: # any error case
    print(None)
else:
    print(long_to_bytes(res // 2)) # divide 2*m by 2 and coverts int to bytes of the result

r.close() # close connection
```
- Running this gave plaintext 60f50 which is the decryption password of open ssl for secret file. Entering it gives the flag.
